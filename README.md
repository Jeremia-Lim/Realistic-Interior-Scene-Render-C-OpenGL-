How I Approach Designing Software

When I approach software design, I start by breaking large problems into smaller, manageable components and thinking in terms of reusability and clarity. For my 3D graphics project, I used object-oriented design to structure the code into logical classes such as SceneManager, ShapeMeshes, and custom draw functions. This helped me visualize how each object and behavior fit together in the larger scene.

Design Skills and Process

This project strengthened my ability to think spatially and aesthetically in software design. I learned to balance the artistic aspects—lighting, color, and material—with the technical foundation of transformations and shaders. I followed an iterative design process, starting with simple geometry and expanding toward more complex forms, adding details like textures and lighting once the scene structure was solid. These tactics can be applied in future projects that combine technical logic and creative visualization, such as game design or interactive simulations.

Development Approach and Strategies

My development process focused on modularity, debugging, and iteration. Each milestone introduced a new concept—camera control, textures, or lighting—and I integrated these incrementally, testing and refining each step. I also learned to use GLM for matrix operations, manage texture UV scaling, and structure my scene for scalability. Over time, I moved from procedural coding toward organized, reusable functions that mirror real-world software engineering practices.

Iteration and Evolution

Iteration played a huge role in my project’s success. Early on, I encountered errors with texture loading and camera rotation, but debugging these taught me how to isolate rendering issues and make small, systematic changes. By the final project, I was comfortable reading shader output and adjusting object transforms mathematically instead of by trial and error.

The Role of Computer Science in My Goals

Computer science is central to my professional goal of combining software engineering with electronics and visual computing. Computational graphics has expanded my technical vocabulary in both mathematics and physics, teaching me how code can simulate real-world light, motion, and materials. These skills will carry into my future studies and professional work, especially in areas like simulation systems, visual AI, and embedded visualization.

Future Applications

This course gave me hands-on experience with OpenGL and introduced the fundamentals of 3D rendering pipelines, which will serve as a foundation for learning Unity, Unreal Engine, or Vulkan in the future. More importantly, it strengthened my ability to think visually as an engineer—bridging logic with creativity, and code with design.
